<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a demonstrative project given to us by the JUMPlus program for us to demonstrate our skills with React, Spring Boot, AWS, and MySQL databases. The stated goal of the project was something akin to yelp, a sort of service where users can leave reviews on restaurants, admins can manage restaurants, and anyone can search the website for restaurants and information on them.

This is the database files from the project, which can be pretty safely ignored. The API should auto-generate the tables and columns in them, as it will primarily be managing the data.

### Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
  * Spring Security
  * Spring Testing
  * Spring JPA
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* MySQL Server
* MySQL Shell

### Installation

2. Download the Repo's SQL files.
3. Create a "restaurant_review_database" database for the other servicecs to point to.
    - The name of the database can be changed as long as you change it in the API's application.properties.
* Optional:
  1. Run the SQL files inside a shell pointing at the created database.
  1. Add desired admins and users into the tables.
